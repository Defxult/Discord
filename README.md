## üëÄ Linux Support
When it comes to hosting your bot, you'll notice that when it comes to macOS servers, they can be really expensive. Not only does this put a burden on you, but it makes the library less appealing to use. With this library being so young and releasing its very first version in May 2023, there's still a lot of work to do and this is one of those tasks. Discord.swift linux support is in development! With that said, so far its kind of a big change, so people who are already using the library should expect a handful of breaking changes. Not only is it required, but there were a few things I wanted to change anyway but was a little hesitant to just because I didn't want to push a breaking change. I'll say it now, expect breaking changes while the library is still in beta. Beta versions of...well anything is the time where you get things right, and I don't want to rush anything whatsoever. Linux support for Discord.swift will be released for version 0.1.0-beta. In the mean time, if anything pertinent occurs from the time of this readme update (Sep. 1, 2023), Discord.swift will continue to get updates on versions 0.0.X-beta. Thank you for all the support so far! Here's to the future release of 1.0.0 üçª.

**TL;DR** - Linux support for Discord.swift is in development and is scheduled to be released early October 2023 (hopefully sooner ‚ù§Ô∏è).
